start up application
This is the first addition to my README from VS Code
This is the next addition to my REAME from GitHub
This is going to be a merge conflictThis is another addition to the README from GitHub

1. Here is the start of some of my notes 
2. I thought it was interesting and cool how you can merge git conflicts or just accept one of them so quickly and easily

Startup Elevator Pitch
Do you ever feel like your friends listen to really good music that you haven't heard before? Do you ever feel like you found a new, unique song after perusing spotify or apple music in the middle of the night, and now you want to share it with everyone? MusiConnect is an anti-social, social media platform that allows you to share one song per day so that all of your friends can see and listen to it, leading to quick and easy music sharing. All you do is share one song you liked from the day, and you can quickly scroll through and hear bits from other songs that your friends share.

Class Notes

Converting to React
1. Understand the differences between web development and React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces while web development involves a variety of technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll need to understand how React works and its basic concepts such as components, state, and props.
2. Break down the web file into components: One of the key features of React is the ability to break down the user interface into smaller, reusable components. You should analyze the web file and identify the different parts of the interface that can be turned into components.
3. Use JSX to define components: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like syntax within your JavaScript code. You can use JSX to define your React components and their properties.
4. Manage state and props: React components have a concept of state and props. State refers to data that changes over time within a component while props are properties that are passed down to a component from its parent. You'll need to manage state and props within your React components to ensure they function as expected.
5. Use React libraries and tools: There are many React libraries and tools available that can help you convert your web files to React more easily. For example, you can use React Router to handle routing within your application, or use a CSS-in-JS library like Styled Components to manage your CSS styles.
6. Test your components: Finally, it's important to test your React components thoroughly to ensure they work as expected. You can use tools like Jest and Enzyme to create automated tests for your React components.

HTML
1. HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language" and is used to create web pages.
2. HTML is made up of elements, which are defined by tags enclosed in angle brackets. Examples of tags include <html>, <head>, and <body>.
3. The basic structure of an HTML document includes an opening and closing <html> tag, which contains an opening and closing <head> tag and an opening and closing <body> tag.
4. The <head> tag contains metadata about the document, such as the page title, links to external stylesheets or scripts, and other information that is not displayed on the page.
5. The <body> tag contains the content of the page, including text, images, and other media.
6. HTML has several types of elements, including block-level elements and inline elements. Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width of their container, while inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
7. Some common HTML elements include headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and tables.
8. HTML has several attributes that can be added to elements to provide additional information or functionality. Examples of attributes include class, id, href, src, alt, and style.
9. HTML also allows for the use of special characters, such as copyright symbols (&copy;), em dashes (&mdash;), and en dashes (&ndash;).
10. HTML5 is the current version of HTML and includes new features and elements, such as semantic tags (<header>, <footer>, <article>, etc.), the <video> and <audio> elements, and support for responsive design.
  
CSS
1. CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and is used to style web pages.
2. CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles to them. Examples of selectors include element selectors (p, h1, ul, etc.), class selectors (.example), and ID selectors (#example).
3. CSS styles are defined in rules, which consist of a selector and one or more declarations. Declarations consist of a property and a value, separated by a colon. 
4. CSS has several types of properties, including font properties (font-family, font-size, etc.), color properties (color, background-color, etc.), layout properties (width, height, margin, padding, etc.), and many more.
5. CSS also includes several types of units for specifying values, such as pixels (px), ems (em), and percentages (%).
6. CSS can be applied to HTML documents in several ways, including via external style sheets, internal style sheets, or inline styles.
7. CSS also includes several advanced features, such as media queries for targeting specific device types or screen sizes, animations and transitions for creating dynamic effects, and the use of preprocessors like Sass or Less for more powerful styling capabilities.
8. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation can be used to speed up the development process by providing pre-built styles and layout components.
9. CSS is constantly evolving, with new features and capabilities being added in CSS3 and CSS4.
  
JavaScript
1. JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
2. JavaScript code can be added to HTML documents using the <script> tag, either inline or in an external file.
3. JavaScript has several data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.
4. JavaScript includes several operators, such as arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %), comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, <, <=, >, >=), and logical operators (&&, ||, !).
5. JavaScript includes several control structures, including if/else statements, for loops, while loops, and switch statements.
6. JavaScript includes several built-in functions, such as alert(), prompt(), and console.log().
7. JavaScript includes several methods for working with arrays and objects, such as push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice(), slice(), Object.keys(), and Object.values().
8. JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS, such as changing the content of an HTML element or updating the styles of an element.
9. JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular can be used to create more complex web applications.
10. JavaScript also includes several APIs for working with external data sources and services, such as the Fetch API for making HTTP requests and the Geolocation API for working with location data.
11. alert() function: The alert() function is used to display a message in an alert box. 
  a. alert("Hello, world!");
12. prompt() function: The prompt() function is used to display a message in a dialog box that prompts the user to enter some text.
  a. var name = prompt("Please enter your name:");
13. console.log() function: The console.log() function is used to output messages to the console for debugging purposes. 
  a. console.log("Hello, world!");
14. push() method: The push() method is used to add one or more elements to the end of an array. 
  a. var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
     fruits.push("grape", "kiwi");
     console.log(fruits);
15. slice() method: The slice() method is used to extract a section of an array and return a new array containing the extracted elements.
  a. var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     var slice1 = numbers.slice(1, 3);
     var slice2 = numbers.slice(3);
     console.log(slice1); // Output: [2, 3]
     console.log(slice2); // Output: [4, 5]

React
1. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. React uses a component-based architecture to create reusable UI elements.
3. React components can have state and props, which allow them to respond to user interactions and update their appearance accordingly.
4. React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI without the need for full page reloads.
5. React supports server-side rendering, which can improve page load times and SEO.
6. React can be used with other libraries and frameworks, such as Redux for state management or React Native for building mobile apps.
7. React provides a set of lifecycle methods for components, which allow developers to hook into various stages of a component's existence.
8. React supports a declarative programming model, where developers describe what they want the UI to look like and React takes care of the underlying implementation details.
9. React provides tools for testing components, including a test renderer and utilities for mocking and simulating user interactions.
10. React is maintained by Facebook and has a large and active community of developers, which means there are many resources and tools available for learning and using the library.
