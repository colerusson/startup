start up application
This is the first addition to my README from VS Code
This is the next addition to my REAME from GitHub
This is going to be a merge conflictThis is another addition to the README from GitHub

1. Here is the start of some of my notes 
2. I thought it was interesting and cool how you can merge git conflicts or just accept one of them so quickly and easily

Class Notes
1. CSS is very diverse and you can handle it in many ways, including linking to a CSS file, or writing the style directly into the HTML
2. You can even create stuff using just CSS, and almost no HTML
3. Remember to read up on CSS selectors

HTML
1. HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language" and is used to create web pages.
2. HTML is made up of elements, which are defined by tags enclosed in angle brackets. Examples of tags include <html>, <head>, and <body>.
3. The basic structure of an HTML document includes an opening and closing <html> tag, which contains an opening and closing <head> tag and an opening and closing <body> tag.
4. The <head> tag contains metadata about the document, such as the page title, links to external stylesheets or scripts, and other information that is not displayed on the page.
5. The <body> tag contains the content of the page, including text, images, and other media.
6. HTML has several types of elements, including block-level elements and inline elements. Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width of their container, while inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
7. Some common HTML elements include headings (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.), paragraphs (<p>), lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>), links (<a>), images (<img>), and tables (<table>, <tr>, <td>).
8. HTML has several attributes that can be added to elements to provide additional information or functionality. Examples of attributes include class, id, href, src, alt, and style.
9. HTML also allows for the use of special characters, such as copyright symbols (&copy;), em dashes (&mdash;), and en dashes (&ndash;).
10. HTML5 is the current version of HTML and includes new features and elements, such as semantic tags (<header>, <footer>, <article>, etc.), the <video> and <audio> elements, and support for responsive design.

Kahoot/Review Notes
1. @import url("google fonts link here"); - you can use this CSS to load fonts from Google
2. CSS property padding - puts space around the content of selected elements
3. console.log(f(n)) can call a function and output it
4. In HTML <div> creates a division element
5. CSS box model order starting from outside going in - margin, border, padding, content
6. HTML tag for an unordered list - <ul>
7. Invalid JavaScript function - function f(x) = {}
8. Valid JavaScript functions: const f = (x) => {}; function f(x) {}; const f = function(x) {}
9. Valid ways to include JavaScript in HTML: <script>1+1</script>; <script src='main.js' />; <div onclick='1+1' />
10. Ivalid - <javascript>1+1</javascript>
11. Valid JavaScript object - { n:1 }
12. Invalid: { n=1 }; { "n"=1}; { "n"="1" }
13. DOM textContent property - sets the child text for an element
14. Valid hyperlink HTML - <a href='https://c.com'>x</a>
15. Turn only a certain text blue - div.header { color: blue; }
16. Valid JSON - {"x":3}
17. Invalid: {'x':3}; {"x":undefined}; {x:3}
18. Console comman to make a script executable - chmod +x deploy.sh
19. DNS subdomain example - c260.cs.byu.edu
20. To point to another DNS record, use this DNS record type - CNAME
