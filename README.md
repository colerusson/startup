Startup Elevator Pitch
Do you ever feel like your friends listen to really good music that you haven't heard before? Do you ever feel like you found a new, unique song after perusing spotify or apple music in the middle of the night, and now you want to share it with everyone? MusiConnect is an anti-social, social media platform that allows you to share one song per day so that all of your friends can see and listen to it, leading to quick and easy music sharing. All you do is share one song you liked from the day, and you can quickly scroll through and hear bits from other songs that your friends share.

Class Notes
1. CSS is very diverse and you can handle it in many ways, including linking to a CSS file, or writing the style directly into the HTML
2. You can even create stuff using just CSS, and almost no HTML
3. Remember to read up on CSS selectors
