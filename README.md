Startup Elevator Pitch
Do you ever feel like your friends listen to really good music that you haven't heard before? Do you ever feel like you found a new, unique song after perusing spotify or apple music in the middle of the night, and now you want to share it with everyone? MusiConnect is an anti-social, social media platform that allows you to share one song per day so that all of your friends can see and listen to it, leading to quick and easy music sharing.

-Storage of user data (info, friends, liked songs)
